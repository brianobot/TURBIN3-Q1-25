## Anchor Stuffs
- you can initialize an anchor project to use rust for testing with ```anchor init --test-template rust <project_name>```
- ```anchor deploy``` and ```anchor test``` would use the cluster speocief in the Anchor.toml file
- Programs are updated by deploying the program to the same address
- you can close a program to reclaim the SOL allocated to the program
  - once a program is closed, the program ID can not be used to deploy a new program
-

##¬†Other Random Stuffs
- When using the ```close``` constraint in the Account struct, the account passed to the close
constraint MUST be the signer of the instruction
- Everything above u32, can not be represented correctly in JS number and therefore we must use BN to represent Big Numbers
  ```js
  import { BN } from "bn.js";

  let bigNumber = new BN(1);
  ```
- Whenever you add ```anchor-spl``` as a dependenc for a program, also add the ```idl-build``` for it in the features section of the 
Cargo.toml file
- CPI calls cost money!
- As the Amount of CU decreases the chances of getting to the block increases

## Anchor CPIs and Errors
- anchor cpi feature generates CPI helper functions for invoking instructions on existign anchor program
- if you do not have access rto CPI helper function, you can still use invoke and invoke_signed directly
- ```error_code``` attribute macro is used to create Custom Anchor Errors

CPIContext are used to create CPI Context which are similar to COntext, 

Fields on the CPIContext include;
- accounts: List of accounts needed for the CPI Call, Type must implements the ```ToAccountMetas``` adn ```ToAccountInfos<'info>``` traits, which are added by ```#[derive(Accounts)]``` attribute macro
- remaining_Accounts
- program
- signer_seeds

To create a new one that passes the current transaction signature to the transaction that would be perform by the cpi use this

```rust
CPIContext::new(cpi_program, cpi_accounts);
```

You use ```CPIContext::new_with_signer``` to construct  new instance when signing on behalf of  PDA for the CPI

```rust
CPIContext::new_with_signer(cpi_program, cpi_accounts, seeds);
```

When calling another anchor program with a published crate, anchor can generate instruction builders and CPI helper functions for you, simple add the program as a dependency to your ```Cargo.toml``` file and specify the ```cpi`` feature

```Toml
[dependencies]
callee = { path = "../callee", features = ["cpi"] }
```
by doing so, you have enable cpu feature and your program gains access to the callee::cpi module.
the cpi modules turns callee's instruction handlers into Rust functions, these functions takes CPIContext and any extra data needed for the instruction, 

### Errors
Ultimately all programs return the same error type ```ProgramError```, however you can use ```AnchorError``` as an abstraction on top of the ProgramError, 

fields on the AnchorError
```rust
pub struct AnchorError {
  pub error_name: String,
  pub error_code_number: u32,
  pub error_msg: String,
  pub error_origin: Option<ErrorOrigin>,
  pub compared_values: Option<ComparedValues>,
}
```

you can add custom errors like so
```rust
#[error_code]
pub enum MyError {
    #[msg("MyAccount may only hold data below 100")]
    DataTooLarge
}
```
you can use the ```require!``` macro to simplify returning errors
