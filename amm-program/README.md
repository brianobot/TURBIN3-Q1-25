```tl-dr```
This protocol allows for instantaneous exchange of tokens without waiting for a counterpart to complete the trade.
this is achieved 

price determination based on the constant product curve
if x represent a certain token 
if y represent another token

a Pool of x-y is created to facilitate exchange of x and y and vice versa between users
the pool must hold quantity of x and y such that they are in proportion of 1:1 based on their value

if x = $10
and y = $20

the pool must contain 2x: y
