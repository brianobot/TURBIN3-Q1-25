# Turbin3 Pre-Requisite Task on TypeScript 

This task was designed to test the ability of the budding solana developer to follow instructions
and intentionally fix errors that came up while following the instructions. It is also a gentle way
to initiate the developer into the hands on experience with building software for the solana blockchain


## Some Tips and Best Practices
- All Development keys (wallets, and possibly envs) are ignore in the version control system so they are not exposed
- Proper Code documentation with inline comments to explain certain decisions and processes
- Use of Utility functions and modules to make developement and testing smoother and easier
